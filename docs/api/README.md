API docs
========
This folder contains documentation for our publicly exposed APIs.

## Internal APIs
We consider that an API is _internal_ when it is not expected to be used by any third-party. We will not provide any
support for these APIs, and they are subject to change **without any previous warning**.
- [OpenAPI spec](internal.json)
- [Swagger UI](https://automattic.github.io/wp-job-manager/api/internal/)
