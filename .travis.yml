# Travis CI Configuration File

# Tell Travis CI we're using PHP
language: php

# Setup a global environemnt and overide as needed
env:
  global:
    - WP_TRAVISCI=phpunit

cache: yarn

# Next we define our matrix of additional build configurations to test against.
# The versions listed above will automatically create our first configuration,
# so it doesn't need to be re-defined below.

# Test WP trunk/master and two latest versions on minimum (5.2).
# Test WP latest two versions (4.5, 4.3) on most popular (5.5, 5.6).
# Test WP latest stable (4.5) on other supported PHP (5.3, 5.4).
# Test WP trunk/master on edge platforms (7.0, hhvm, PHP nightly).

# WP_VERSION specifies the tag to use. The way these tests are configured to run
# requires at least WordPress 3.8. Specify "master" to test against SVN trunk.
